<b>Procedure</b>
<br><br>
VISAP uses a single-blind review process: submitted material is not required to be anonymized.
 <br><br>
All submissions must be made using the <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">IEEE VGTC Electronic Conference System</a>. After creating an account or signing in, submitters will find the VISAP’18 Papers and Exhibition submissions by 1) clicking on the “Submissions” tab, 2) selecting the VIS 2018 conference, and 3) selecting “VIS 2018 VIS Arts Program (VISAP’18)”, and finally clicking on “Go”.
<br><br>
At least one author per accepted paper is required to attend the IEEE VIS conference to present the work. Submitters of accepted artworks and annotated portfolios are also strongly encouraged to attend the conference to set up their work for the opening reception, and to participate in the program throughout the week.
<br><br>
We invite students to apply to the IEEE VIS <a href="http://vissv.org/">student volunteer</a> program to help cover registration fees.

<!-- Exhibition Instruction -->                      
<b>Exhibition instructions</b>
<br><br>
We invite artists and designers to submit artworks related to the theme data and identities. We welcome submissions in any medium, e.g., interactive projections, multimedia sculptures, mobile devices, illustrations, video game art, digital prints, screen-based art, fixed audio-visual pieces, etc.
 <br><br>
<b>What to consider</b><br><br>
Elements to consider that will be helpful for the reviewers include: explaining how your work relates to this year’s theme and to information visualization, scientific visualization, and/or visual analytics; describing technical details of the project; and discussing the reception of your work at previous exhibitions (if it has been exhibited before). You will also want to describe the installation requirements of your work in terms of space and equipment. Explain where there is flexibility in case we cannot meet every requirement. Additionally, you will need to provide links to high-resolution images, audio, and/or videos that will help give the reviewers a clear sense of your work. Accepted submissions will be included in the VISAP’18 exhibition catalog and may be featured in a special section of Leonardo.<br><br>
<p><b>Examples Topics</b></p>
Artworks could involve any of the following:
<ul>
  <li>visualization that emphasizes aesthetics</li>
  <li>visualization that encourages creative interaction</li>
  <li>speculative visualizations</li>
  <li>visualization as tactical media</li>
  <li>new data paradigms</li>
  <li>live coding and streaming data</li>
  <li>complex systems</li>
  <li>exploratory data semantics</li>
  <li>3D visualization, VR environments, and immersive analytics</li>
  <li>computational photography</li>
  <li>ambient information displays</li>
  <li>visualization as storytelling</li>
  <li>design studies</li>
  <li>data sonification</li>
  <li>conversation theory</li>
  <li>digital humanities visualization</li>
</ul>
                        
   <br>    
<b>Previous accepted work</b>
<br><br>
Please see the 2017 catalog (designed by Esteban Garcia), the 2016 catalog (designed by Jeremy Boy), the 2015 catalog (designed by Jack Henrie Fisher), the 2014 catalog, or the 2013 catalog (both designed by Lauren Thorson) to get a sense of the range of artworks that have been accepted previously. Note that this is the second year in which we are explicitly soliciting design submissions; please feel welcome to contact the chairs if you have questions about whether or not your work is an appropriate submission to VISAP.
<br><br>
                        
                        
                        
<b>Acceptance</b>
<br><br>
All accepted work will be included in the online proceedings of VISAP on the visap.net website, as well as in a printed catalog that will be handed out during the VISAP opening reception. In addition to accepting installations that may run for the duration of the exhibition, some artworks may be selected for a shorter installation during the week of the IEEE VIS conference. Performance submissions may also be scheduled for specific times during the exhibition. We cannot guarantee help with shipping costs, so please bear that in mind when submitting work with unusual requirements. We will be able to provide some equipment for exhibitors; if considered for acceptance, the VISAP’18 Exhibition Chairs will contact the exhibitor to determine the required equipment. All accepted artworks will be documented in the IEEE VISAP’18 exhibition catalog, which will be available both online and in print.
<br><br>
                        
                        
<b>New!: Annotated Portfolio instructions</b>
<br><br>
New this year, we invite artists and designers to submit works to exhibit related to the theme data and identities.
<br><br>
Artists, designers, and researchers all make creative choices based on practical knowledge, generally acquired through experience. Unfortunately, this knowledge is seldom shared in publications. VISAP aims to foster discussions around this reflection-in-action when creating visualizations or data-driven art pieces.
<br><br>
For the first time at VISAP, we invite designers to submit annotated portfolios and annotated projects related to the theme of data and identities. These submissions reflect either on shared concepts among a selection of own visualizations, or on the design process of a single work. Whether in the case of a single artifact, or in the case of a series of artifacts, the designer is in a unique position to provide valuable insights into the design intentions, the design space explorations, and the design process (Löwgren 2013). Through annotated portfolios and annotated projects, submitters are invited to communicate their visualization practices in rich, heavily visual ways.
<br><br>
                            
<p><b>What to consider</b></p>
Elements to consider that will be helpful for reviewers include
<ul>
  <li>The appropriateness and richness of the visual style.</li>
  <li>The quality of presentation</li>
  <li>The production value of images, photos and diagrams.</li>
</ul>
                        
   <br> 
<p><b>Example topics</b></p>
Projects could involve any of the following:
<ul>
  <li>visualization that emphasizes aesthetics</li>
  <li>visualization that encourages creative interaction</li>
  <li>speculative visualizations</li>
  <li>visualization as tactical media</li>
  <li>new data paradigms</li>
  <li>live coding and streaming data</li>
  <li>complex systems</li>
  <li>exploratory data semantics</li>
  <li>3D visualization, VR environments, and immersive analytics</li>
  <li>computational photography</li>
  <li>ambient information displays</li>
  <li>visualization as storytelling</li>
  <li>design studies</li>
  <li>data sonification</li>
  <li>conversation theory</li>
  <li>digital humanities visualization</li>
</ul>
                        
   <br> 
                        
<b>What we mean by annotated portfolio and annotated project</b><br><br>
An annotated portfolio is a collection of design works with brief textual annotations. It has been proposed by Gaver and Bowers (2012) as a “way to communicate design research”. The systematic selection and annotation of the artifacts are part of the contribution. Submitters are encouraged to highlight important features, discuss how ideas were developed, and reflect on recurring topics through their series of works.
<br><br>
An annotated project is a visual description and reflection of the design process of a single visualization project. It is intended to capture the situated and rich nature of design. See DIS Pictorials for inspiration.

<b>Acceptance</b><br><br>
Accepted submissions will be part of the VISAP’18 exhibition. They will be on display as printed booklets in a special section of the exhibition. They will also be showcased in the VISAP’18 catalog, which will be available both online and in print.
