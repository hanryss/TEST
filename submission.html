All accepted work will be included in the online proceedings of VISAP on the visap.net website, as well as in a printed catalog that will be handed out during the VISAP opening reception. In addition to accepting installations that may run for the duration of the exhibition, some artworks may be selected for a shorter installation during the week of the IEEE VIS conference. Performance submissions may also be scheduled for specific times during the exhibition.
<br><br>
We cannot guarantee help with shipping costs, so please bear that in mind when submitting work with unusual requirements. No artist fee or travel costs are provided. Depending on availability of funding, some day registrations may be provided to selected artists.
<br><br>
We will be able to provide some equipment for exhibitors; if considered for acceptance, the VISAP’19 Exhibition Chairs will contact the exhibitor to determine the required equipment.

<h4>Pictorials instructions</h4>
<p>
We invite artists and designers to submit works to exhibit related to the theme Beyond Borders.
<br><br>
Artists, designers, and researchers all make creative choices based on practical knowledge, generally acquired through experience. Unfortunately, this knowledge is seldom shared in publications. VISAP aims to foster discussions around this reflection-in-action when creating visualizations or data-driven art pieces.
<br><br>
We invite designers to submit pictorials and annotated portfolios related to the theme of Beyond Borders. These submissions reflect either on shared concepts among a selection of own visualizations, or on the design process of a single work. Whether in the case of a single artifact, or in the case of a series of artifacts, the designer is in a unique position to provide valuable insights into the design intentions, the design space explorations, and the design process (Löwgren 2013). Through pictorials and annotated portfolios, submitters are invited to communicate their visualization practices in rich, heavily visual ways.
<br><br>
                            
<b>What to consider</b><br>
Elements that reviewers will look for include:
<ul id="paperlist">
  <li>The appropriateness and richness of the visual style.</li>
  <li>The quality of presentation</li>
  <li>The production value of images, photos and diagrams.</li>
</ul>
                        
   <br> 
<p><b>Example topics</b><br>
Projects could involve any of the following:
<ul id="paperlist">
  <li>visualization that emphasizes aesthetics</li>
  <li>visualization that encourages creative interaction</li>
  <li>speculative visualizations</li>
  <li>visualization as tactical media</li>
  <li>new data paradigms</li>
  <li>live coding and streaming data</li>
  <li>complex systems</li>
  <li>exploratory data semantics</li>
  <li>3D visualization, VR environments, and immersive analytics</li>
  <li>computational photography</li>
  <li>ambient information displays</li>
  <li>visualization as storytelling</li>
  <li>design studies</li>
  <li>data sonification</li>
  <li>conversation theory</li>
  <li>digital humanities visualization</li>
</ul>
                        
   <br> 
                        
<p><b>What we mean by Pictorial and Annotated Portfolio</b><br>
A pictorial is a visual description and reflection of the design process of a single visualization project. It is intended to capture the situated and rich nature of design. See <a href="http://dis2018.org/submi/pictorials.html">DIS Pictorials</a> for inspiration.
<br><br>
An annotated portfolio is a collection of design works with brief textual annotations. It has been proposed by Gaver and Bowers (2012) as a “way to communicate design research”. The systematic selection and annotation of the artifacts are part of the contribution. Submitters are encouraged to highlight important features, discuss how ideas were developed, and reflect on recurring topics through their series of works.
<br><br>
                        
<p><b>Previous accepted work</b><br>
Please see the five pictorials (<a href="http://visap.net/2018/media/Cruz-VISAP18-AP.pdf">1</a>, <a href="http://visap.net/2018/media/Bihanic-VISAP18-AP.pdf">2</a>, <a href="http://visap.net/2018/media/Perin-VISAP18-AP.pdf ">3</a>, <a href="http://visap.net/2018/media/Glissmann-VISAP18-AP.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://visap.net/2018/media/Hunter-VISAP18-AP.pdf ">5</a>) from the inaugural edition of this format in the <a href="http://visap.net/2018/program">2018 program</a>.
<br><br>                        
                        
<p><b>Acceptance</b><br>
Accepted submissions will be part of the VISAP’19 exhibition. They will be on display as printed booklets in a special section of the exhibition. All accepted pictorials will be included in the online proceedings of VISAP on the visap.net website. They will also be showcased in the VISAP’19 catalog, which will be available both online and in print. Selected submissions will be invited to present their work in one of the two VISAP Papers session during the conference.
